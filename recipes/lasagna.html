    <h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
    <p>
      So on <em>this</em> picture we can see how our dish will look like just in
      a <strong>minute</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>So for our future recipe we will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Lean beef</li>
      <li>Prosciutto</li>
      <li>Passata</li>
      <li>Hot beef</li>
      <li>Nutmeg</li>
      <li>Mozzarella</li>
      <li>Fresh lasagna sheets</li>
      <li>White sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook
        750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all
        over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through
        the meat mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml
        hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks
        rich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish
        (about 30 x 20cm).
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some
        fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g
        ready-made or homemade white sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining
        390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.
      </li>
      <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
      <li>
        Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the
        top is bubbling and lightly browned.
      </li>
    </ol>
